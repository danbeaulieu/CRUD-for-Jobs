CRUD for Jobs for Play! Framework v0.1
======================================
The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Jobs module is a module that adds a Job info to your existing 
CRUD admin. Useful for quickly seeing which jobs have run, last time they ran, how they are scheduled to run, etc.
